## Project Overview
This project analyzes Nigeria’s FinTech market to provide data-driven insights for a startup looking to refine its product offerings, pricing strategy, target customer segmentation, and marketing approach. The goal is to understand user preferences, financial behavior, and economic status to help the startup optimize its services and reach the right audience effectively.

## Tools
### Data Processing & Analysis
- Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data generation and manipulation

### Data Visualization & Interpretation
- Power BI: Interactive dashboards for market trends, pricing structures, and customer segmentation.

### Research
- CBN & NBS Reports: Official statistics on financial inclusion, income distribution, and digital finance adoption.
- Industry Research & FinTech Websites: Insights into services, pricing models, and consumer behavior from platforms like Flutterwave, Paystack, OPay, Kuda, and Carbon.

## Workflow

 - Demographics (Age, Gender, Employment, Income Level).
 - Financial Literacy (Understanding of banking, investments, and budgeting).
 - Preferred FinTech Services (Mobile banking, digital payments, micro-loans).
 - Service Delivery Preferences (Self-service vs. agent banking).

- CBN & NBS Reports → Used official financial inclusion data to ensure realistic income levels, banking adoption rates, and digital transaction trends.

- Industry Research & FinTech Websites → Analyzed pricing structures, services, and customer trends from leading Nigerian FinTech firms

### Data Generation & Processing:

 - Financial Literacy (Classified as Low, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, or Expert).
 - Business Ownership Segments (Young Professionals, Urban Professionals, Small Business Owners, Rural Users).
